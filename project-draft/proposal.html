          <!-- Problem Description -->
          <h2>Problem Description: </h2>
          <p>
            Traveling is often a source of joy, yet the planning process can be
            stressful. Have you considered island hopping through Indonesia's
            captivating archipelago? Navigating the diverse array of Indonesian
            islands can prove quite challenging, particularly for foreigners and
            tourists. Personal experience has shown me that with minimal grasp
            of the Indonesian language, booking flights becomes a daunting
            task. Identifying the right flights and ensuring the security of
            the booking website can be a real struggle, especially when faced
            with seemingly dubious platforms. While platforms like
            <a href="https://book.citilink.co.id/Search.aspx" target="_blank">
            Citilink</a> aim to address these concerns, their user interface
            often lacks the credibility necessary to instill confidence in
            tourists entrusting their finances. However, with the launch of my
            new website JavaAir, travelers can now enjoy a seamless and
            trustworthy booking experience tailored specifically to their needs.

          <!-- Proposed Application -->
          <h2>Proposed Application: </h2>
          <p>
            The JavaAir application caters to two distinct user groups: workers
            and clients. Workers are tasked with managing airline appointments,
            while clients engage in booking tickets. This platform is poised to
            have a positive impact on minority groups, particularly those facing
            language barriers when navigating Indonesian booking websites. By
            offering a modern interface and multilingual support
            (in the future), including English and eventually Indonesian,
            JavaAir aims to bridge these language divides, making travel booking
             more accessible and equitable for all users.
          </p>
          <p>
            On JavaAir, workers have dedicated features allowing them to post
            and manage airline availability, as well as handle cancellations.
            Clients, on the other hand, can browse, filter, and book available
            flights using interactive search and booking functionalities.
            Furthermore, clients have access to their transaction history,
            enabling them to track past purchases and appointments. This
            comprehensive set of features ensures that both workers and clients
            can efficiently navigate the platform and manage their travel
            arrangements effectively. All the information viewed will be
            user-generated and stored inside of a database (and possibly
            local storage), excluding any use of outside-source APIâ€™s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, JavaAir's user-centric approach addresses common challenges
            faced by minority groups, such as language barriers and outdated
            website designs on Indonesian booking platforms. Through its
            intuitive interface, multilingual support (future feature), and
            robust feature set, JavaAir aims to enhance accessibility and
            usability, offering a more inclusive and streamlined travel booking
            experience for all users, regardless of language or background.
