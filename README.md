**Proposal**
- Navigating the diverse array of Indonesian islands can prove quite challenging, particularly for foreigners and tourists. Personal experience has shown me that with minimal grasp of the Indonesian language, booking flights becomes a daunting task. Identifying the right flights and ensuring the security of the booking website can be a real struggle, especially when faced with seemingly dubious platforms. While platforms like Citilink aim to address these concerns, their user interface often lacks the credibility necessary to instill confidence in tourists entrusting their finances. However, with the launch of my new website AirIndo, travelers can now enjoy a seamless and trustworthy booking experience tailored specifically to their needs.
